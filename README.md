# Case Study — Stroke Treatment Analysis
## Advancing Patient Care through Predictive Analytics: A Machine Learning Approach
This project bridges healthcare and data science, aiming to significantly impact stroke treatment and patient outcomes. It employs a machine learning approach through predictive analytics to analyze and interpret patient data effectively.

**Background**

Addressing the challenge of stroke, a prevalent health issue, this project leverages a comprehensive dataset from a healthcare organization. The dataset includes detailed records of around 40,000 stroke patients, covering aspects like medical history, treatment details, and patient demographics.

**Objective**

The primary goal is to utilize this data to uncover patterns and insights that could lead to improved strategies for stroke treatment. The project encompasses various data science techniques, including statistical analysis, machine learning algorithms, and data visualization, focusing on enhancing the effectiveness of treatment protocols and identifying key factors that affect patient recovery and outcomes.

**Dataset Overview**

The anonymized dataset comprises records of 43,401 patients, each characterized by variables such as age, gender, medical history, and lifestyle. The central aspect of this study is to develop predictive models to assess the risk of stroke, thereby facilitating early intervention for high-risk patients.
- ID: Unique Identification Number
Gender – categorical variable (Male, Female, Other)
- Age_In_Days: indicates patient’s age in days
- Hypertension: binominal variable (1 – patient has hypertension, 0 – patient without hypertension)
- Heart_Disease: binominal variable (1 – patient has heart disease, 0 – patient without heart disease)
- Ever_Married: binominal variable (Yes – patient is (was ever) married, No – patient has never been married)
- Type_Of_Work: categorical variable related to different working status (patient is self-employed, works in a private firm, has a government job, never worked or is still a child)
- Residence: binominal variable (Urban – patient currently lives in urban area, Rural – patient currently lives in rural area)
- Avg_Glucose: patient’s average glucose level for the past 3 months
- BMI: patient’s current BMI score
- Smoking_Status: categorical variable that indicates patient smoking habits
- Stroke – binominal target variable (1 – patient after stroke, 0 – patient never had stroke)

**Methodology**

- Design and implementation of a predictive model using Python or R, focused on stroke risk prediction.
- Testing and evaluation of different machine learning algorithms, followed by a thorough comparison and selection of the most suitable model based on performance metrics.
- Preparation of a comprehensive presentation to summarize the approach, findings, and recommendations, as well as to outline potential future enhancements to the model.
